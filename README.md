# Momiji, a moderation bot for Discord

Momiji is a general purpose Discord bot focused on supplying flexible commands for moderation and role management.
She also come packed with logging functionality and a multitude of informative commands.

In her current state, I won't be releasing her, but you're more than welcome to pull the code from here and tinker with it.
She's written in Lua using the [Discordia library](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) and all of her settings are stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Currently, she is not ready for anyone looking to simple clone the repo and set her up with your own token.
* I **do not** have routines set up to configure an empty database, I will do this soon. (i.e. You have to read the code and find out what the Database expects)
* I make no guarantees that my code here will work as expected for anyone else. Use at your own risk.
* Anyone is free to open issues and I'll look into things as best I can.
