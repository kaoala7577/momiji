# Momiji, a moderation bot for Discord

Momiji is a general purpose Discord bot focused on supplying flexible commands for moderation and role management.
She also come packed with logging functionality and a multitude of informative commands.

She's written in Lua using the [Discordia library](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) and all of her settings are stored using RethinkDB.

In her current state, I cannot guarantee stability, but I use her with no major issues.

Currently, she's functional in a few guilds.
* I make no guarantees that my code here will work as expected for anyone else. Use at your own risk.
* Anyone is free to open issues and I'll look into things as best I can.
